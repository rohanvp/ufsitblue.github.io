# Sandbox vid 10: Creating user accounts

### What does the "useradd" command actually do?

e.g. Adding a new user, "bob", with `useradd`:

1. It makes a new **group** called bob
2. It makes a new **user** called bob
3. It creates its home directory at `/home/bob`
4. It copies some standard files for new users from `/etc/skel`, which include stuff like .bashrc (shell config)
5. It prompts a password (with the `passwd` command)
6. It prompts for stuff like full name, "room number", etc. (this gets stored in the /etc/passwd file, but no one really bothers with it)
